# Locchef

## Project Purpose

Locchef is a full-stack MERN marketplace that connects local home chefs with customers looking for fresh, homemade meals. The platform enables users to browse meals, place orders, make secure payments, track deliveries, and leave reviews, while chefs can manage meals and orders. Admins oversee users, requests, orders, and platform-wide statistics.

This project is designed to demonstrate real-world application development skills, including authentication, role-based access control, secure payments, and dashboard analytics.
